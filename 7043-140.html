Booting misc things on the IBM 7043-140

This machine is also known as the rs/6000 43p model 140, and finding documentation on it is scarce at best.

Firmware Access
===============
Firmware can take it's time to gather clues and actually start an interface.

If booting from serial port (9600 8n1), system will begin firmware init by writing a series of "RS/6000", then 'memory', 'keyboard', 'network', 'scsi', 'speaker'. There are several keys you can press to enter diagnostic utilities immediately after 'keyboard' displays.
  1) Enter System Management Services
     a somewhat easier interface for setting and displaying system settings. on-screen menu based.
  8) Enter Open Firmware
     'reset-all' will restart the machine and get out of open firmware.

Windows NT
==========
Using the arc151 diskette here is fine to boot the system. I swapped the matrox-based (and firmware supported) video board for a S3 Vision864 board. Specifically a Diamond Stealth64 from a PC. ARC can initialize this video card by itself, so diag output actually goes to the serial port.

Once ARC begins, the keyboard is initialized in a way my KVM (Linksys ProConnect) can't cope with, you will need to use a direct-attached keyboard. Windows NT itself does not suffer from this once actually booted.

ARC/Windows NT here does not cope with a 16GB disk, but it seems fine with an 8GB one.

Trying to start the driver for the onboard pcnet ethernet crashes the NT kernel with a machine check.

AIX 5.1
=======
This is the last version of AIX that boots. 5.2 starts bootstrap and hangs.

For installing AIX from CD, just make sure the CD is an attempted device before hard disk. Insert 'Volume 1 of 5' and reset the system.

The system will reconfigure the boot device, so it is ok to leave the CD in after boot.

CD1 is actually all you need to complete a basic install :)
