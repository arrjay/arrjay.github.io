      <description>Environment Variables as a Program Bootstrap Previously, I talked about environment variables relating to system level environment variables. This article expands on that with an examples of a program that uses your environment to flexibly communitacte between components, demonstrating ways to effectively use those.
An example with ssh-agent Using ssh-agent is a way to improve the usability of encrypted ssh keys - that is, you can have keys stored encrypted on disk, and the agent program will manage loading and unlocking keys for you.</description>

      <description>The foundation of containerization - chroot There is a lot of current popularity around the concept of linux containers, and here I wanted to detail one of the underpinnings - the chroot syscall.
Why Linux containers are not some mythical black box - they are a collection of files, combined with startup mechanics to perform an isolated task. The chroot system is very much the foundation of this by allowing a program (and any programs it starts) to have a different concept of a base filesystem.</description>

      <description>Hacking in Facebook Object Graph Image tags for hugo posts Just detailing that as of this commit I added support for setting Facebook Object Graph preview-image settings in my Hugo templates. It was really to add in the front matter, actually, once I realized you can refer to anything in front matter under Params. The main tricky thing was FB wanted absolute URIs, so I had to use absURL (which I did, in the next commit).</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s lots of discussion for operating systems about processes, ipc, files and such, I wanted to take a moment and touch on some internals I find incredibly useful in my day to day work. Environment variables!
NOTE: I&amp;rsquo;m really only covering Linux/OS X/POSIX class systems here, Windows (and PowerShell) have some slightly different edges.
What Via Wikipedia - an environment variable is &amp;ldquo;a dynamic-named value that can affect the way running processes will behave on a computer.</description>

      <description>So this site is set up using Hugo and I figure I&amp;rsquo;d detail a little bit of why.
Static generator with a live updater One of the easier ways to do hosting is to have a simple collection of files to upload to a webserver, rather than building a server environment to run a blog engine. This also gives you the capability to more easily move your site between providers.</description>
