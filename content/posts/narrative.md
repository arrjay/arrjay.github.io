Some criticism I received about my earlier article on environment variables highlighted a really big deficiency! I provided a large
chunk of technical detail and explanations without a larger narrative. So in this post, I'd like to detail a few the reasons to be
interested.

# Appreciating the magic

As popular as it may be, "the cloud" is very much a declaration of _abstraction_ - you don't need to /usually/ worry about it, until you do.
Detailing what goes on underneath is a way I gain appreciation of how much work goes into the fnished object.

# Details matter, surroundings matter

Computers in general require precision. Programming languages don't let you forget the precision, they shift the kind of precision you need to
track. A trade off of bare CPU instructions for a realization of the assumptions your language and environment gave you.

# Creation

The ultimate goal here is to inspire people to not only build their own low level projects, but also be able to approach if something higher
level malfunctions. Everything runs somewhere. You don't have to be "cloud-native" - this is mostly stuff you can do in a scratch vm, or your
own desktop.
