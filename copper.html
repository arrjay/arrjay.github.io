Copper is an installation of Darwin 8.0.1. Installing Darwin is...finicky.

Avoid installing to ufs, that seems to work very poorly.

(For ESXi - easiest)
  Virtual Machine - version 8 Hardware
  Hard disk 1 should be attached to IDE bus (0:0)
  768MB of RAM seems to be plenty.
  E1000 ethernet adapter works here as well.
  For Guest OS I selected Other (FreeBSD (32-bit))
  Once up and running, you probably want to tweak settings to always boot from CD first - simply disconnect from image when we're done.

Boot pass 1 - drop to shell
  initialize the partition table manually here using fdisk - 'fdisk -i -a hfs /dev/rdisk0' is what I did
  type exit at this point and the system will attept to reboot (actually shuts down for me)

Boot pass 2 - install
  select your drive (1) to install on to, choose to use existing partitions
  root partition should be /dev/disk0s1 at this point - format as hfs and do a clean install
  install should proceed at this point.
  at the end, you are asked to seet a root password and hostname for the system.
  select 2 to attempt reboot (shutdown in my case) - you can disconnect the cdrom at this point.

Optional Steps
==============
Enable ssh by running 'service ssh start'. This will persist across reboots.

To actually configure static networking for ethernet devices use ncutil. 3.1.3 won't run at all on an unpatched darwin, 3.0b1 will run, and just dump a lot of localization errors. '[0 ]$' is the ncutil prompt in the below session.

NIS Configuration
=================
set NISDOMAIN=j.hack in /etc/hostconfig and reboot
