This machine can only hole alphabios *or* SRM in flash memory. This means you cannot flip from booting NT to booting OSS things without reflashing the machine.

To flash from alphabios to SRM:
  In the backend, get 'lx164nt.rom' to actually be the SRM firmware image. If using my puppet mess, netboot::flag::alphapc_164lx_defaultfw: 'srm' should do what you want.
  Press F2 during boot to enter setup
  Choose "AlphaBIOS Upgrade..." from the menu. Wait for it to finish scanning the floppy.
    It should say "SRM Console 5.8-1 000621.1129" as the new version if all went well. Press F10 to do the flash. Power cycle the system (yes, the power switch!) to actually reboot.

To switch from PC Console to Serial port in SRM:
  at the '>>>' prompt
  set console serial
  init (to reboot)

To switch back
  set console graphics
