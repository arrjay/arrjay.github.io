If installer drops to a # prompt complaining about bpgetfile - don't worry, just type 'exit' - you're doing an interactive install anyway.

At some point the installer will look at the amount of RAM in the box (64MB baby!) and stop. So we need to configure a disk, and swap *now*, then continue the installation.
- run 'format' to see the disks attached to the machine - you probably want disk 0, type '0' at the prompt.
- if asked to label the disk, choose 'yes'
- this will set up a partition table for you, which you probably don't want. I've got a 4GB disk in the LX, but for simplicity, I create only two partitions - swap and /.
  - edit partition 6 (to remove it) - tag unassigned, starting cyl 0, size 0
  - edit partition 1 - tag swap, starting cyl 0, 128M or so
  - print the partition table to find where partition 1 ends
  - edit partition 0 - tag root, starting cyl (partition 1 + 1), size...I actually just used 3.5G and called it good.
  - 'quit' the label menu, then 'label' the disk, finally 'quit' the partitioner.
- now activate the swap with 'swap -a /dev/dsk/c0t0d0s1'
- finally type 'exit' to get back to the installer.
